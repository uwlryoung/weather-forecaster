## Challenges To Work On / Future Updates to this Page
- Prevent a user from entering in a city that doesn't exist
- Use an API to have a dropdown search when typing in cities (e.g. with Google Maps) 
- Use location services so that it finds the closest city you are looking for (e.g., Alexandria, VA, not Alexandria, Egypt)
